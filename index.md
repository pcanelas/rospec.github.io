## Introduction

- Introduction to robotic systems and ROS
- ROS has the component-developer and the system-developer
- 
- 

RQ:
- How effective are specification based techniques at identifying architectural misconfigurations in component-based robotic systems? 
- 
- 


**ROSpec** is a lang 


### 1. Installation

The tool is available for download on [Github](https://github.com/pcanelas/rospec) and can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip  install rospec
```

### 4. How to use



In case you haven't installed Bundler, install it:

```
gem install bundler
```

You'll want [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to make sure all the Ruby gems needed work well with your project. Bundler sorts out dependencies and installs missing gems or matches up gems with the right versions based on gem dependencies.

### 4. Option 1: Build the Theme (*without* the github-pages gem) {#option1}

Use this option if you're not planning to publish your Jekyll site using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Bundler's Gemfile specifies how project dependencies are managed. Although this project includes a Gemfile, this theme doesn't have any dependencies beyond core Jekyll. The Gemfile is used to list gems needed for publishing on Github Pages. **If you're not planning to have Github Pages build your Jekyll project, delete these two files from the theme's root directory:**

* Gemfile
* Gemfile.lock

If you've never run Jekyll on your computer (you can check with `jekyll --version`), you may need to install the jekyll gem:

```
gem install jekyll
```

Now run jekyll serve (first change directories (`cd`) to where you downloaded the project):

```
jekyll serve
```

### 4. Option 2: Build the Theme (*with* the github-pages gem) {#option2}

If you *are* in fact publishing on Github Pages, leave the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock files in the theme.The Gemfile tells Jekyll to use the github-pages gem. **However, note that you cannot use the normal `jekyll serve` command with this gem due to dependency conflicts between the latest version of Jekyll and Github Pages** (which are noted [briefly here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)).

You need Bundler to resolve these dependency conflicts. Use Bundler to install all the needed Ruby gems:

```
bundle update
```

Then *always* use this command to build Jekyll:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you want to shorten this long command, you can put this code in a file such as jekyll.sh (on a Mac) and then simply type `. jekyll.sh` to build Jekyll.

## Running the site in Docker

You can also use Docker to directly build and run the site on your local machine. Just clone the repo and run the following from your working dir:
```
docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up
```
The site should now be running at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

This is perhaps the easiest way to see how your site would actually look.
